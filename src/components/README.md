# Components Directory

This directory contains all React components organized by role and functionality.

## Structure

- **ui/**: shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- **common/**: Shared components used across multiple roles (Header, Footer, Loading, etc.)
- **manufacturer/**: Manufacturer-specific components
- **distributor/**: Distributor-specific components
- **hospital/**: Hospital-specific components
- **admin/**: Admin-specific components

## Guidelines

1. Keep components small and focused
2. Use TypeScript for all components
3. Export components from index.ts
4. Include tests for complex logic
5. Use shadcn/ui components when possible
